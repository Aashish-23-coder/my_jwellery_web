    <h1>Our Legacy of Gold and Trust</h1>
    <p>
        The story of Shree Dhanlaxmi Jewellers traces back to the early 1990s B.S., 
        during the Rana regime, long before democracy arrived in Nepal. It was then that my great-grandfather, 
        driven by skill and dedication, began crafting gold and silver ornaments in the heart of Kathmandu Valley.
        What started as a small workshop gradually became a trusted name for purity, craftsmanship, and honesty.
        The business flourished for generations, passed lovingly from father to son. However, during my grandfather's era, 
        a devastating robbery forced the family to close the doors of our ancestral shop. Despite this setback, the spirit of our legacy never faded. 
        Years later, in 2072 B.S., my father, Mr. Gopal Lakandri, proudly revived Shree Dhanlaxmi Jewellers in Birtamode, Jhapa, carrying forward our family tradition of trust, artistry, and devotion to excellence.
        Today, we stand as a symbol of resilience and craftsmanship â€” a legacy shaped by generations and strengthened by time.
